# Why are we surprised by any of this?

We've spent the last decade slowly removing all agency from our own work. Why are we surprised that our overlords would take that last step for us? We've turned outselves into machine learning algorithms. Of course those algorithms are
taking our jobs for us We run "experiments" in the hopes of finding what works and then the moment we find a button that works we press it into obliviion we press a button and line goes up it doesn't matter that the line goes up a little
less every time we have the runway. we have the investors. we can still press that button so no wonder we're being replaced no wonder the people who had us press the button are now enamored by the machine that can press the button just as
well we're so fucking cooked
